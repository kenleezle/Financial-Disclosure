Title: How to use this Graph

Use this tool to plot a senator or a congressman's stock holding compared against the S&P500 (in grey).

1) Select an official. This will cause that politician's holdings to be displayed on the graph. A black dot represents the start or end of a position.
2) Hover over a position to see the stock ticker, as well as the performance of that stock over the period it was held by the official.
3) Visually review the performance of all of the official's holdings against the performance of the S&P 500.
